# Logic Programming 
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Logic Programming course.

The Course focuses in Logic Programming concepts using Prolog. 

## Exercises 

This folder stores exercises solved to gain some practical insight in Logic Programming. They are divided in Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes.

- **TP1:** Representation of knowledge in prolog
- **TP2:** Control and Recursion in Prolog
- **TP3:** Lists in Prolog
- **TP4:** Solution Search
- **TP6:** Meta-Programming
- **TP9:** Constraint Programming

## Other exercises 

This folder includes some separate exercises I solved that are not included in any specific context.

## Tests

Tests I solved to better prepare myself for tests exams.

## Projects 

Projects made to apply Logic Programming concepts in a wider system, to solve real problems. They were both developed with my partner [Jo√£o Campos](https://github.com/Pastilhas) and the the original repository they were developed on was can be found [here](https://github.com/Pastilhas/PLOG-FEUP).

- **Gap:** Implementation and automatic solving of [Gap Puzzles](https://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/puzzle/gap/).
- **Mbrane:** Implementation of the [Mbrane](www.mbranegame.com/) game for both two players, a player vs the computer and two computers playing.
